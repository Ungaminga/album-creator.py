# album-creator.py
Creates video from mp3 files + logo pic for youtube upload.
### Usage:
album-creator.py album_directory <output.mp4>
Your `album_directory` must contain `album.(png|jpeg|gif)`, which generator will use as image.
The creator will create track timestamps, that appears in programm output. You can use redirecting output (i.e. `>` or `>>`) to have file with timestamps or whatever.
